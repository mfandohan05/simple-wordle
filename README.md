Wordle Clone: Python Implementation
Overview
This is a text-based Python clone of the popular word-guessing game Wordle. Players have up to six attempts to guess a secret five-letter word, with feedback provided after each guess using colored emojis:

üü© (Green) for correct letters in the correct position
üü® (Yellow) for correct letters in the wrong position
‚¨úÔ∏è (White) for incorrect letters
The project demonstrates core programming concepts like loops, conditionals, string manipulation, and function abstraction.

Features
User Input Handling: Ensures the user input matches the expected word length.
Emoji Feedback: Provides clear feedback using emojis to show which letters are correct, misplaced, or incorrect.
Modular Design: The game logic is divided into separate functions for better code readability and organization.
Game Loop: Allows players to make up to six guesses, with an early win condition if the word is guessed correctly.
How to Play
The game prompts you to enter a five-letter word.
You‚Äôll receive feedback in the form of emojis:
üü© (Green): Correct letter in the correct position.
üü® (Yellow): Correct letter, but in the wrong position.
‚¨úÔ∏è (White): Incorrect letter.
You have six attempts to guess the word correctly. If successful, you‚Äôll see a winning message. If not, the correct word is revealed.
